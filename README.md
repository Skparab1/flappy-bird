# Flappy-bird
- Replicating the video game flappy bird in Python
- so far version in repo is incomplete
# What is done so far:
- bird moving up a bit when control c is pressed
- if you hit the ceiling, you lose (could be removed, in the actual game there is no ceiling)
- if you hit the ground, you lose
- right now the bird looks like this: (0)>
# What is to be done
- working on lane defining and updating
- most likely I will
- pipes and crash detection
- hold press override (if you hold control + c the program will crash)
  - can be solved with the same thing that I did with crossy road
